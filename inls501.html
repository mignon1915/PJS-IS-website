<h2>Translation and Interpretation of the <i>Lied</i>:</h2>
<h2>An Annotated Bibliography</h2>
	<p>Priscilla Jane Smith</p>
	
	<p>This bibliography is a compilation of sources dealing with the interpretation and translation of German art song, or <i>Lieder</i>. The <i>Lied</i> is a distinctive type of German musical composition, for one voice and piano, which came into being as an outcome of the Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Both the piano and the vocal parts demand artistic interpretation, and the poetry selected for this type of song is often of a high literary quality. Poets whose work is often used in <i>Lieder</i> include Goethe, Eichendorff, Heine, Hesse, Mayrhofer, Mörike, Rilke, Rückert, and Schiller. I have chosen to include sources on the topic of art song in general and those specifically about <i>Lieder</i>. I also include sources dedicated entirely to the works of the five best-known and most prolific <i>Lieder</i> composers, Johannes Brahms, Robert Schumann, Franz Schubert, Richard Strauss, Hugo Wolf, and Gustav Mahler. A general knowledge of musical terminology and of the German language is assumed for most of these sources. Although this topic might be one that would demand more multimedia resources than I have provided, I did not feel many of those available were worthy of inclusion because of their poor quality. <i>Youtube</i> is an excellent source of videos of incredible musicians singing <i>Lieder</i>, but there is so much poor content on the site and the videos can be so hard to find that I felt it best not to include the website in this collection. Additionally, the only other online source for translation of <i>Lieder</i> texts besides the one included in this bibliography is pay-per-use and is full of inaccuracies and incorrect information. I believe that this collection of sources includes a variety of types of sources on the subject, and has the potential to be very useful for performers and historians of <i>Lieder</i>.</p>

		<p>This resource at <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780810801493">The Scarecrow Press</a></p>
		<p>This resource is a standard source in the field. Berton Coffin is a well-known authority on vocal pedagogy and vocal music. This resource includes little introduction and lacks a table of contents, but the content is very valuable. The entries are listed alphabetically by composer, and include the name of the composer, the title of the song in the original language and in English translation. The texts are written in the original language and include a literal and a poetic translation, line-by-line. The book also includes an index of song titles and first lines. One draw-back to this source is that it does not include the names of the poets of the song texts.</p>

		<p>Hailed by <i>Choice</i> as “the standard <i>Lieder</i> resource for the English-speaking world,” the <i>Fischer-Dieskau Book of Lieder</i> was the very first source I thought to include in this bibliography. A famous baritone, Fischer-Dieskau’s name is synonymous with the performance and interpretation of the songs of this genre. The content of the book is simply organized alphabetically by song title. Each entry includes the song title in German and English, the name of the poet, a list of composers who have set the poem to music, and the German text and its English translation, side-by-side. Although the translations are poetic, they expertly capture the essence of the original German texts. The source does not include IPA transcriptions. Another great aspect of this resource is its three excellent indexes. The first is an index of composers, listed alphabetically by last name, with a list of the songs by each composer included in this book. The second is an index of poets, listed alphabetically by last name, with a list of the poems by each author included in this book. The third is an index of song titles and first lines, listed alphabetically.</p>

		<p>This resource on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=r5pB-wQoSGcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false">Google Books</a></p>
		<p>This resource is a fantastic introduction to the wide field of art song. Although it is not specifically targeted towards <i>Lieder</i>, includes no song texts, translations, or IPA transcriptions, its content warrants inclusion in this bibliography. The author is a professor of voice at the University of Las Vegas, and is a respected authority on vocal literature, voice, and opera. The first important feature of this book is its table of contents, which could double as an index. Its “Literature” section is very well organized, first by nationality of composer, then alphabetically by last name. Under each composer’s name a list of the songs mentioned in this book are included. So, within the table of contents, one can find a list of every composer and song mentioned in the book. I find this incredibly helpful and thoughtful on the part of the author. The first section of the book, “Style,” includes an introduction to the concept of musical style (the coalescence of a song’s melody, harmony, rhythm, and text). This section also includes “style sheets” for each major art song composer. These “style sheets” are guides to the individual style of each of the composers, including characteristic melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic qualities. This is a unique concept which can be used as a valuable tool for a young singer who has not yet become familiar with the works of a particular composer. The “Style” section of the book also includes a collection of quotes about style in vocal music from famous musicians. The “Literature” section includes a chapter on <i>Lieder</i> specifically, which includes short biographies of composers, and thorough information about selected songs by all major composers of the genre. The three indexes in this book are fantastic. The first is an index of composers and their selected works, listed alphabetically by composer’s name. The second is an index of the titles of songs, cycles, and works, listed alphabetically, and the third is an index of composers organized by nationality. The book also includes a selected bibliography of references for further study, which is organized by language.</p>

		<p>John Reed, a distinguished Schubert scholar, wrote <i>The Schubert Song Companion</i> with collaborators Norma Deane and Celia Larner. It is the first book to discuss each of Schubert’s more than 600 <i>Lieder</i>, and an incredibly valuable addition to this bibliography. Franz Schubert is widely accepted as the “father” of the German <i>Lied</i>, and this book is, in my opinion, the authoritative source for information about the <i>Lieder</i> of Franz Schubert. The book begins with a foreword from famous English mezzo-soprano Janet Baker, a preface, and an extensive list of abbreviations. The book is divided into two main sections; “The Songs” and “The Authors.” The songs each have an entry, and are listed alphabetically. Each entry includes the title of the song in German and in English, the name of the poet, the date of composition, the original key, other source materials in which the song can be found, a musical example of the first line of the song, a poetic translation of the text in English, and a short description of the song and its history.</p>
		<p class="topline"><img src="reedSongEntry.JPG" width="450" height="200" alt="reedExp" class="noborder"></p>
		<p>The second section of the book, “The Authors,” includes an alphabetical list of every poet from which Schubert took texts. These entries include a short biography of the poet. The book also includes seven wonderful appendixes. The first appendix, entitled “How Many Schubert Songs?” discusses the much-debated topic of what songs Schubert actually wrote and which are incorrectly attributed to him. The second appendix discusses the emotional color of the individual keys in which Schubert composed, and includes a list of songs composed in each key. The third appendix discusses the thematic links between Schubert’s songs and his instrumental works, and the fourth is a month-by-month mapping of Schubert’s compositional output over his lifetime. The fifth appendix is a representation of Schubert’s compositional life as a succession of poetic phases (Schubert was known for setting numerous texts by one poet and then abandoning that poet to find a new one). The sixth appendix is a chronology of the publication of Schubert’s songs, and the seventh is a guide to the tempo indications and expression marks which Schubert wrote into his music. </p>

		<p>Thilo Reinhard is a professional translator and pianist. His book, <i>The Singer’s Schumann</i>, is a valuable addition to this bibliography because of its many wonderful features. It includes chapters on Schumann’s <i>Lieder</i>, Schumann’s relationships with his collaborating poets, a guide to German pronunciation and diction, and essays on the problems associated with transposition of Schumann <i>Lieder</i> and Schumann’s key-characters. Also included is an excerpt from Schumann’s <i>Musical Rules for Home and Life</i>, a collection of the composer’s thoughts on excellent musicality. Each of the songs has an entry, and these are sorted by opus number. Each entry includes detailed information about the song, and the full text in German, English translation, and IPA transcription, as show here:</p>
		<p class="topline"><img src="reinhard1.JPG" width="300" height="300" alt="reinhardExp1" class="noborder"></p>
		<p>Also included are the date of composition and date of publication, if known, the publisher, any dedications made by the composer, the literary source of the poetry and the year in which it was written. Reinhard also includes a poetic translation of every text to go along with the literal one, for further clarity:</p>

		<p>This resource’s indexes and appendices alone make it a strong addition to this bibliography. The book includes two appendices; one which is a chronology of Schumann’s life, with major works and artistic and historic events. The second appendix is an index of songs by opus number. Other indexes include a general index, and index of all of the works by Schumann, and an index of titles and first lines, organized alphabetically.</p>

		<p>This resource at <a href="http://www.leyerlepublications.com/?v=song_texts">Leyerle Publications</a></p>
		<p>This collection of transcriptions and translations of the complete <i>Lieder</i> works of Johannes Brahms was compiled by Beaumont Glass, well-known opera coach and stage director. I chose to include Glass’ five texts because they provide word-for-word and line-by-line translations and IPA transcriptions of the complete <i>Lieder</i> works of Brahms, Wolf, Strauss, Schumann, and Schubert. These are the only resources of their kind targeted towards an English-speaking audience. Beaumont Glass’ volume on the songs of Johannes Brahms includes a brief overview of the composer’s life, a chapter on the interpretation of Lieder, and an introductory chapter on the format of the book and German phonetics. This chapter includes excellent information on the pronunciation of the German language, and in itself is an excellent reference source. Each of Brahms’s songs has its own entry, with detailed information about the poet, the origin of the text, and a brief description of the song. These are organized alphabetically. The title is given in German, in English translation, and in IPA transcription. The opus number and date of composition are also given, if known. The text is laid out as follows: IPA above the original German text and a literal translation below the German text.</p>
		<p class="topline"><img src="glass1.JPG" width="600" height="125" alt="glassExp" class="noborder"></p>
		<p>As shown, Glass does an excellent job to make sure that the text is spaced out so that it is clear which German word goes with each English word. He also includes a poetic translation of the text if the literal English translation is unclear or confusing. The appendix is comprised of poetic singing translations of several of Wolf’s most famous songs, selected and created by Glass. These translations were designed so they could be sung in English to the original music with as few rhythmic changes as possible. Also included in the book is an index of song titles and first lines. Although this resource has no table of contents, I feel it is an excellent resource and a valuable addition to this bibliography.</p>

		<p>I chose to include this resource because it is a thorough overview of the genre and its history. I wanted to include a source that would put all of the others in context historically and within the wide field of classical singing. A highly authoritative source, this member of the <i>Cambridge Companion</i> series is comprised of contributions by fourteen well-respected historians on the subject of <i>Lieder</i>. I was particularly drawn to this book because of the chapters “Why the <i>Lied</i>?” and “In the beginning was poetry” because no other resources I know of include sections dedicated to the uniqueness of the genre or the history of the poets of <i>Lieder</i> texts. The book also includes entire chapters devoted to the <i>Lieder</i> of Schubert, Schumann, Liszt, Brahms, and Wolf, and also includes lists of the complete <i>Lieder</i> works of Strauss and Mahler. The book also includes a chronology of the historical context of the <i>Lied</i> (from 1729 to 2002), a thorough guide to suggested further reading and an index of important names and concepts mentioned.</p>

The book includes an entry for every one of Wolf’s 242 songs, and each chapter deals with one of Wolf’s songbooks. Each song entry includes the name of the song in German and translated into English, the composition date, the key of the piece and the range of the vocal line.

This third edition of the book includes a thorough overview of Schumann as a song-writer, and the characteristic motifs he used in his songs. The book includes an entry for every one of Schumann’s 246 songs, and the songs are divided into chapters which cover a certain period in Schumann’s compositional life.

While the Wolf and Schumann books do not include the German text of each song, this book does. The book begins with overviews of Brahms as a song-writer and the characteristic motifs he used in his songs, and additionally includes a section on the major thematic topics Brahms chose to use in his songs. The entries for each of Brahms’ 212 songs are arranged by opus number, and include the name of the song in German and its English translation, the composition date, the key of the piece and the range of the vocal line. There are several very helpful appendices and indexes which make this resource even more valuable. The first appendix lists all of the poets associated with Brahms’ works, and includes a short biography for each. There is an extensive select bibliography of sources related to the book.

This online source includes numerous fantastic recordings of <i>Lieder</i>, but it can be quite daunting to weed through the many poor recordings and random results.

The site also includes recordings of the correct pronunciation of composer’s and artist’s names, an overview of important musical terms, and audio book transcriptions about the history of classical music with listening examples.

The book includes a very thorough introduction to Brahms’ song composition with several enlightening quotes by the composer himself. Each of Brahms’ 196 published songs has an entry, and they are organized by opus number. Each song entry includes the title in German and its translation into English, the opus number, the name and dates of the poet, the text in German and a poetic translation into English. Also included are the date of composition, the date of the first performance, if known, and the musical form of the song. Stark also gives a detailed description of each song, its historical context, and its interpretation.

		<p>Although this book is one of the few sources available on the subject of <i>Lieder</i> by Gustav Mahler, I found it useful enough to include in this bibliography. The book is organized chronologically by song cycle beginning with the early songs and ending with the <i>Kindertötenlieder</i>. Mahler’s largest collection of <i>Lieder</i>, <i>Des Knaben Wunderhorn</i>, is separated into five chapters, each dealing with songs on a similar theme. The book contains selected texts only, and the poetic translations are not side-by-side but listed sequentially (German text first, then English translation below). The distance between the texts may be problematic for those unfamiliar with the German language. However, the detailed information provided about the composers and individual songs is very valuable. Although the book contains no index, a very thorough six-part bibliography is included. The resources listed include those about Mahler as a musician, the texts and their poets, the music and the poetry, the <i>Lied</i> and its composers, a general and miscellaneous bibliography, and a list of works referenced in this book.</p>

		<p>This web resource is a collection of “texts used in 104,186 <i>Lieder</i> and other classical art songs.” Since the goal of the Archive’s author, Emily Ezust, is to translate these texts into as many languages as possible, there are translations into English, French, Italian, Dutch, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese, among other languages. Although an online source like this has the potential to be incredibly valuable, this web page leaves much to be desired. The design is very outdated, and the page is relatively difficult to navigate. Another major problem with the page is that translations are done by volunteers, so the content has virtually no authority. Search functions available are by surname, first line, title, year, collection, or “search entire website.” There are also several indexes, navigable alphabetically, of composer name, poet name, first line, song title, and language. Song entries may or may not include a text in the original German or a translation into English. The translations are side-by-side with their original German counterparts, but there is no consistency in their quality. A typical song entry will include the title in the original language, the text in the original language, the name and dates of the poet, the name and dates of any associated composers, and a list of available translations. Other features of the page include “random song cycle” and “random text” buttons, which point visitors to random entries on the page. </p>
